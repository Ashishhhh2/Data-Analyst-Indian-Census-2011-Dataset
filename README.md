# Indian Census 2011 Data Analysis
This project dives into the Indian Census 2011 dataset to uncover demographic, educational, and religious insights across states and districts. It uses Python and pandas for data wrangling, with visualizations powered by matplotlib and seaborn.

# Key Questions Explored
What is the total population per state?

How do religious populations vary across states?

What are the literacy and worker statistics for major cities like New Delhi, Jaipur, and Lucknow?

Which state has the highest number of male workers?

How can we style and format the DataFrame for presentation?

# Technologies Used
